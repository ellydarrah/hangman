# Hangman Project

This is a fun little game app I made as part of my self-learning during my Software Engineering Apprenticeship.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React with TypeScript

Thanks to Web Dev Simplified for the tutorial that provided the base for this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ONUyenGnWw

## How To Run It

In the terminal: `npm i` then `npm run dev`.

## Note:

- React.Strict mode is turned on, meaning that components render twice in dev.

## Lessons Learned:

- Don't forget some learning materials can include deprecated code, e.g. the "keypress" eventListener used in the original tutorial. I followed the React documentation to discover that I could use onClick instead. This solved my errors, albeit with slightly altered functionality - namely that my version of the app doesn't recognise keyboard hits.
